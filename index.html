        Hello everyone! My name is Nishant Kashyap. In this website I will be telling you about the Science behind Climate Change. So, let's get started
        <hr size = 20% color = "red">
        <h2><u>The Greenhouse Effect</u></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Imagine our planet like a Greenhouse. Sunlight passes thorugh the Earth's atmosphere, warming the surface. Certain gases in the atmosphere, like carbon dioxide, act like a blanket, and preventing it from escaping back into space. This process keeps our planet warm and habitable</li>
            <li>The Probelm: Human activities, primarily the buring of fossil fuels, are increasing the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The disturbs the natural balance, causing the planet trap more heat, leading to global warming</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        There is evidence to this problem, like rising temperature since the 19th century. This process is occuring since the last 2000 years. Scientists have found that there are bubbles in the ice, which were showing the rise in CO2. Other evidences are Sea Level Rise and Change in Weather Patterns.

        <h2><u>What Will Happen Next</u></h2>
        The same process descirbed above will continue unabated in the future if no controls are imposed. So, we should spread awareness about it. Please share this website with your friends and please search more baout this yourself. Thank You and have a nice day!
